# R Markdown (`.Rmd` or `.rmd`)

An R Markdown file is a plain text file that uses the extension .Rmd. 

It contains three major components:

* A YAML header surrounded by `---`
* Chunks of R code surrounded by triple-backticks (see below)
* Text and text formatting using the Markdown syntax
  
R Markdown files allow the generation of well-formatted documents (md, HTML, PDF, etc.) that include text, code, and output.

To create such documents, you “Knit” or “render” them. You can do so in two ways: 
* by clicking the “Knit” button in the script editor panel of your R Markdown file
* by running the command `rmarkdown::render("example.Rmd")` as explained [here](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/render.html). You can either select the type of output document (PDF, HTML, md, etc.) or pre-specify it in the YAML header at the top of the file. For example: `rmarkdown::render("example.Rmd", output: html_document`)


# Markdown (`.md`)

Markdown and R Markdown are similar in that they use the same syntax: R Markdown is just an extension of the markdown syntax.

The main difference is that you cannot execute R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks. 

Markdown (`.md`) documents are versatile and widely used. See the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for more info on .md format.


# Basic syntax

### Formatting text

Italics: either use `*` or `_` before and after the *section to be written in italics*. 

Bold: use `**` before and **after**. 

Footnotes: use `^` with the following text in brackets, like^[this]. 

To strike through, use `~~` before and after the text to ~~strike through~~. 


### Lists

For unordered lists, use either `*` or `-` and then a space, and then the text (if there is no space, it will think you mean to italicize). 

* item 1
  + sub
  + sub
* item 2
* item 3
  + sub
  
For ordered lists, write the number followed by a period and a space, then start writing. For nested lists, indent once (or twice) on the next line and use `+` followed by a space. 

1. item 1
    + sub
        + sub sub
    + sub
2. item 2
3. item 3
    + sub


### Hyperlinks, tables, pictures

To insert a link to external sites, put the linked text in brackets `[]`, followed immediately by the URL in parentheses `()`. 
For example: [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

For tables, use `-----` for rows and `|` for columns. See [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) for more.

To insert a picture link type `![text](picture link, "title")`. The title is optional.


### Code chunks

R Markdown allows you to directly insert and evaluate code via "code chunks". To start a chunk, type ``` and then the name of the language in braces:

```{r echo = FALSE}
print("Hello, World!")
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
# add a comment
x <- 2 + 5
x * 2 
```

Note `echo = FALSE` hides your code syntax but still shows the output of your code in the finished file. Use this for writing reports for people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.

There are many more options to manage with your code; consult [chapter 27](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) of R for Data Science for details.
